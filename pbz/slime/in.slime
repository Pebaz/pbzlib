Danger.
This syntax is too large to implement initially.
Must add generics after. This is too much.

:: First Slime File

data-type foo-bar-baz
[
    age i32!
    age !T  :: Bang before == Generic Type XD

    fn get-age<I> {!i32} ()  :: Implies I == Self == foo-bar-baz
    [
        ret ./age  :: `./` is always `self.`
    ]
]
